This script is used to compare the results for n-body simulation runs.

To use it, outputs from all of the implementations have to be dumped as
text files and passed as arguments to this script.

Example (the path might be anything, as
long as it points to valid nbody executable):
work/pony/nbody/nbody 1 20 10000 > pony_nbody.txt
work/go/nbody/nbody 1 20 10000 > go_nbody.txt

./nbody_test.py pony_nbody.txt go_nbody.txt
